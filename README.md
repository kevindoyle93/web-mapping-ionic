## Features
### Match directions
Clicking on a match in the match list opens a page which includes driving directions from the user's current location to the pitch.

### Clubhouse and pitch locations
Users can find details on a club by clicking on an item in the clubs list. Details include the contact info of the club secretary and the locations of the club's clubhouse and all of their pitches.

### Referee availability
A problem for amateur football teams is finding official referees to ref friendly matches. As these are not organised by a league organistation, the clubs must find their own referee. Clicking on any of the referees in the referee list opens a page with their contact details and a map showing the area in which that referee operates. The map includes a polygon of the refree's available area as well as pins for all of the pitches that fall inside that area.
